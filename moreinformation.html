        nature. They are popular pets due to their low maintenance and ability
        to provide companionship. Cats have retractable claws and are known for
        their agility and hunting skills. They groom themselves frequently and
        communicate through a variety of vocalizations. They are known to be
        independent but some can be affectionate with their owners.
